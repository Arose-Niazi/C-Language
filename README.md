## Why?
I just wanted to move all my code at github. I wrote all these in my first semester(FALL 18) at COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore campus.
Edit: Solved few exams in C so those are from semesters later on.

## How to run? Build this code? 
<p align="center"><a url='http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26'><img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/Codeblocks-Windows%20Mac-orange.svg?style=popout-square&logo=codio' /></a></p>
Easiest way to run any of the my code is through compile and run through code blocks. 
Download the mingw version of it, as it includes the compiler.
